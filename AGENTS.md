# Project Rules for Jules
- Stack: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, Convex (Real-time DB), Inngest.
- Context: This is Part 1 of Polaris. Part 2 features are missing.
- Constraint: Do NOT touch the existing Convex schema in `convex/schema.ts` unless a new table is absolutely required for the feature.
- Style: Use TypeScript strictly. No `any`.
